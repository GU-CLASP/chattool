# About

The toolkit is an instant-messaging platform for conducting research on dialogue. The software consists of a chat server and chat clients, written in Java.

The chat-tool makes data-collection and preparation much easier and quicker. Configuration of the server and clients allows experimental designs that are much more standardized and reproducible.
The toolkit can be used "off-the-shelf" to collect and prepare instant-messaging conversations. It is also a powerful, programmable toolkit for conducting experiments on live interaction.

All participants' turns are routed via the server which can be scripted to detect, for example target words, phrases or syntactic constructions. This information can then be used, in real-time to trigger experimental interventions that are sensitive to the interactional context.

The toolkit provides an extensive API for scripting these manipulations, as well as a constantly expanding library of experimental setups that can be reconfigured

## Recorded data

<table style="width:100%" border="0">
   <tr>
    <td>The chattool automatically records all keypresses, words and turns, notifications (including typing notifications and read receipts), number of edits, typing speed, typing overlap.

Instead of costly and time-intensive transcription, all data is immediately available for analysis. The data is saved in a variety of formats - to help both qualitative and quantitative analyses (e.g. loading into SPSS, R, Excel, MATLAB).
