# Getting started

This repository is a netbeans project. If opened in netbeans it should run "out of the box"



## Speeding up development of conversation controller objects

After a while you will probably get bored of going through the process of 
1. Starting the chattool
2. Manually selecting the Conversation Controller object
3. Selecting start

To get round this you can start any Conversation Controller object, along with the required number of clients by using the following syntax:

``javac -jar "chatool.jar" nogui_ccname_autologin CONVERSATIONCONTROLLERNAME````
